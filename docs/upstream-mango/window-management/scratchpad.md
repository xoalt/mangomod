description: Manage hidden "scratchpad" windows for quick access.

mangowm supports two types of scratchpads: the standard pool (Sway-like) and named scratchpads.

## Standard Scratchpad

Any window can be sent to the "scratchpad" pile, which hides it. You can then cycle through them.

**Keybindings:**

```ini
# Send current window to scratchpad
bind=SUPER,i,minimized

# Toggle (show/hide) the scratchpad
bind=ALT,z,toggle_scratchpad

# Retrieve window from scratchpad (restore)
bind=SUPER+SHIFT,i,restore_minimized
```

## Named Scratchpad

Named scratchpads are bound to specific keys and applications. When triggered, mangowm will either launch the app (if not running) or toggle its visibility.

**1. Define the Window Rule**

You must identify the app using a unique `appid` or `title` and mark it as a named scratchpad. The application must support setting a custom appid or title at launch. Common examples:

- `st -c my-appid` — sets the appid
- `kitty -T my-title` — sets the window title
- `foot --app-id my-appid` — sets the appid

Use `none` as a placeholder when you only want to match by one field.

```ini
# Match by appid
windowrule=isnamedscratchpad:1,width:1280,height:800,appid:st-yazi

# Match by title
windowrule=isnamedscratchpad:1,width:1000,height:700,title:kitty-scratch
```

**2. Bind the Toggle Key**

Format: `bind=MOD,KEY,toggle_named_scratchpad,appid,title,command`

Use `none` for whichever field you are not matching on.

```ini
# Match by appid: launch 'st' with class 'st-yazi' running 'yazi'
bind=alt,h,toggle_named_scratchpad,st-yazi,none,st -c st-yazi -e yazi

# Match by title: launch 'kitty' with window title 'kitty-scratch'
bind=alt,k,toggle_named_scratchpad,none,kitty-scratch,kitty -T kitty-scratch
```

## Appearance

You can customize the size of scratchpad windows relative to the screen.

```ini
scratchpad_width_ratio=0.8
scratchpad_height_ratio=0.9
scratchpadcolor=0x516c93ff
```

## Special Workspace (Tag 0)

The special workspace (Tag 0) provides an overlay workspace of windows that can be summoned anywhere with full layout support (Scroller, Master/Stack, Dwindle, etc.). When Tag 0 is active, windows from the underlying workspace remain visible in the background, and all windows on the special workspace are displayed above them.

### Keybindings

```ini
# Toggle the special workspace overlay (Tag 0)
bind=SUPER,s,toggle_special_tag

# Move focused window to/from the special workspace
bind=SUPER+SHIFT,s,tag_special_tag

# Silently send active window to the special workspace without switching
bind=SUPER+CTRL,s,tag_special_silent
```

### Window Rules for Special Workspace

You can automatically assign applications to launch directly on the special workspace using `tags:0`:

```ini
# Automatically open Spotify and Discord in the special workspace
windowrule=tags:0,appid:spotify
windowrule=tags:0,appid:discord
```

### Configuration Options

You can configure background dimming and custom layout gaps for the special workspace:

```ini
# Background dim level when special workspace is active (0.0 to 1.0, default 0.5)
special_dim=0.5

# Inner and outer gaps for windows on the special workspace
special_gappih=10
special_gappiv=10
special_gappoh=20
special_gappov=20
```
