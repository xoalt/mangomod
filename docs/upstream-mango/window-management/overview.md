### Setting Descriptions

- `enable_hotarea` — Toggles overview when the cursor enters the configured corner.
- `hotarea_disable_on_fullscreen` — When enabled, the hot area does not trigger overview while a fullscreen window is focused.
- `hotarea_size` — Size of the hot area trigger zone in pixels.
- `hotarea_corner` — Corner that triggers the hot area (0: top-left, 1: top-right, 2: bottom-left, 3: bottom-right).
- `jump_labels` — Defines the ordered characters used for jump hints when in overview jump mode. Each visible window is assigned a label in this order, and pressing the corresponding key jumps to that window. The number of labels limits how many windows can be assigned hints at once. A label is matched by keycode, resolved the same way as `bind`: against the layouts configured with `xkb_rules_layout` in their configured order, with the reference `us` layout as fallback. Jump mode therefore also works while a non-latin layout is active.

[`overcircle`](/docs/bindings/keys#focus--movement) opens overview; while
overview is open, each trigger cycles focus to the next window on the current
monitor. Release a modifier key or run `toggleoverview` to close it.

By default overview temporarily views every tag on the monitor. Use
`overcircle` with `current_next`/`current_prev`, or run `toggleoverview,1`, to
keep the overview restricted to the current tagset's windows.

### Mouse Interaction in Overview

When in overview mode:

- **Left mouse button** — Jump to (focus) a window.
- **Right mouse button** — Close a window.
